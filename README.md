# Group 10 - US Medical Info

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our selected dataset came from the book, “Machine Learning with R” by Brett Lantz, and was obtained from Kaggle. There is no indication of how or when the data was originally collected. There are 7 columns within the dataset. The first column contains the age and sex of the beneficiary of the insurance claim. Next is BMI, which is an indicator of body mass using the ratio of height to weight, followed by the number of children covered under the health insurance of the beneficiary. The following column describes whether or not the beneficiary is a smoker. Finally, the two remaining columns describe where the beneficiary lives in the US and the individual medical costs billed by the insurance company. The dataset contains 1338 rows. The purpose of the dataset is to assist students who are learning about the basics of machine learning. The description of the book mentions that the datasets are available in the public domain. This suggests that the dataset could also be used for public interest and general learning purposes. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset allows for many research questions to be asked, each stemming from an interest in health statistics. Our group is curious about the effects of multiple medical factors on insurance charges. Some more direct analyses could include whether or not the different quantitative and categorical attributes show interactions that directly impact insurance charges. An example of this would be to explore the relationship between where a person lives and whether or not they smoke in order to see if this increases their insurance charges. Additionally, we are interested in analyzing how the different attributes described in the dataset contribute as determinants of health, which is measured using the BMI scale. In particular, we would like to analyze the effects of smoking status and number of children on the BMI score of each beneficiary. We look forward to building a dashboard to convey our findings as a means for sharing our health and insurance related data.
